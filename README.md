The model was designed for producing on a 3D printer.

‚ö†Ô∏è **In case of any questions** ‚Äì do not hesitate to contact the author in Telegram group ([see below](#contact-me)) and ask.


## HOWTO

‚ö†Ô∏è Before assembling read the topic to the bottom!

This 3D model is highly customizable. So you can configure it for you needs.


### Pre-rendered STL

**TODO add**

### Model Parameters

I used self-explanatory names for OpenSCAD model parameters. But if you still have any questions ‚Äì [contact me](#contact-me).

### Print Settings

Here is an example of my **printing parameters**:

|Name|Value|Comment|
|--|--|--|
|Nozzle diameter|0.4 mm|0.5, 0.6 and even 1 mm could could also be fine. Try!|
|Layer height/First layer height|0.2 mm||
|Perimeters|3||
|Solid layers - top/bottom|6||
|Fill density|25%|15% should be enough|
|Fill pattern|Cubic||
|Supports|Not needed|The model was designed to be printed without any supports|
|Filament|CoPET(PETG)|ABS would be better because of the profile heating)|

It is just an example. So you can play with yours üôÇ. 

It took me a bit more than 2 hours to print on my Graber i3 printer. Printing time depends on kind on printer and the printing parameters.

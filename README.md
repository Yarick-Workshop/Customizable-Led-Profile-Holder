The model was designed for producing on a 3D printer.

‚ö†Ô∏è **In case of any questions** ‚Äì do not hesitate to contact the author in Telegram group ([see below](#contact-me)) and ask.


## HOWTO

‚ö†Ô∏è Before assembling read the topic to the bottom!

This 3D model is highly customizable. So you can configure it for you needs.


### Pre-rendered STL

If you do not need any customizations and would only like to have the same holder as I have ‚Äì you can download prerendered STL file from Thingiverse:

  * https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6643654


### Model Parameters

I used self-explanatory names for OpenSCAD model parameters. But if you still have any questions ‚Äì [contact me](#contact-me).

### Print Settings

Here is an example of my **printing parameters**:

|Name|Value|Comment|
|--|--|--|
|Nozzle diameter|0.4 mm|0.5, 0.6 and even 1 mm could could also be fine. Try!|
|Layer height/First layer height|0.2 mm||
|Perimeters|3||
|Solid layers - top/bottom|6||
|Fill density|25%|15% should be enough|
|Fill pattern|Cubic||
|Supports|Not needed|The model was designed to be printed without any supports|
|Filament|CoPET(PETG)|ABS would be better because of the profile heating)|

It is just an example. So you can play with yours üôÇ. 

It took me a bit more than 2 hours to print on my Graber i3 printer. Printing time depends on kind on printer and the printing parameters. 


### Assembling

To assemble the a LED lamp or a fito-lamp you will need the next **Tools and Materials**: 

|Name|Quantity|Comment|
|--|--|--|
|LED profile|||
|LED strip||Or a FITO-LED strip as in my case|
|LED diffuser|||
|Zip tie 3.6mm x 200mm|5|They are used as fasteners.  Model is customizable so it is possible to configure for other size of zip ties|
|Power Supply 12 or 9 V, 2A|1|12 V led to overheating LED-profile and as result to hypothetical melting of plastic parts. So I've chosen 9 V PS|
|Drill bit ‚åÄ 1.5 mm(?)|1|To drill holes for cables in a Cap|
|Cable|0.3 - 0.5 m||
|Power socket|1||
|Flexible phone holder|1|If you don‚Äôt have one, use a selfie stick or, alternatively, something else in the shape of a pipe will be fine too|
|Drill|1|Even a primitive one because it will be used for drilling plastic parts only|
|File|1||
|Metal cutting saw|1||
|Pliers|1|Or strong fingers to tighten zip ties üôÇ|
|Side cutters|1||
|LED Profile Cap|2|You can either buy or print [Customizable LED-Profile Cap](https://github.com/Yarick-Workshop/Customizable-Tube-Cap)|
|Filament| ~25 g | **coPET (PETG)** is fine, but **ABS** is preferable. Because the LED-profile gets hot. **PLA** - I think not a suitable option for the same reason|
|3D printer|1| Or a friend with a 3D printer üòâ|


‚ö†Ô∏è If you have everything from the table above **follow the next assembling video manual**: https://youtu.be/041HFlZdGfg

*Yeah, the video is in Russian but there are English subtitles too. I tried to do my best translating them to English. But if you see something could be fixed - [let me know](#contact-me) please and I will update the text. The same for text here as well. Thank you in advance!*
